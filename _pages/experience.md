- **Nutanix, San Jose, CA** <br/>
_Software Engineer Intern_ (June 2022 - Sept. 2022) <br/>
1) Designed and implemented a new “Baseline Object Replication” feature to let users replicate pre-existing objects to a remote site, providing customers with low latency data accesses and improved disaster recovery measures<br/>
2) Utilized RocksDB, MapReduce, C++11 and FlatBuffers to first identify pre-existing objects and persist replication requests, and then initialize asynchronous background tasks for replication<br/>
3) Persisted latest replication information in object metadata to block duplicate object replication requests; capped the increase in object metadata size to 0.0075%<br/>
4) Reduced turn-around-time (TAT) significantly by eliminating 100% of object lookup operations during the pre-replication phase; improving user experience for 1000+ Nutanix customers<br/>
5) Won Nutanix US-hackathon (5+ teams) for implementing objects batch operations using Zookeeper, MapReduce, C++<br/>

_Application Developer Intern_ (June 2017) <br/>
This was a month long summer internship during which I was tasked with work of revamping the application's UI to make it more responsive and aesthetically modern. For this, I used Java and XML in the Android Studio IDE. I also desgined the application's UI in a way such that it is consistent with "three-click" rule to further enhance the user eperience.
