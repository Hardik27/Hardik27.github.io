_Application Developer Intern_ (June 2017) <br/>
This was a month long summer internship during which I was tasked with work of revamping the application's UI to make it more responsive and aesthetically modern. For this, I used Java and XML in the Android Studio IDE. I also desgined the application's UI in a way such that it is consistent with "three-click" rule to further enhance the user eperience.
