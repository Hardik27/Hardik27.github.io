_Software Engineer_ (July 2019 - Present) <br/>
After completing my undergraduate studies in Information Technology, I joined UBS as a Software Engineer in July 2019. My business deliveries at UBS involve developing back-end jobs using Java and PL/SQL for executing various RISK calculations. In addition to my BAU, I continued to enhance ‘Meri Dukaan’ based on user feedback. Furthermore, I also worked on the development of ‘Meri Dukaan 2.0’ an online and multiplayer version of the application to help students learn from home. Furthermore, to fulfill my keen interest in AI, I also developed a project- ‘Mock Interview Evaluator’ using AI in collaboration with Pratham, an NGO, to help underprivileged students prepare for job interviews.

_Software Engineer Intern_ (June 2018 - July 2018) <br/>
I interned at UBS for a period of 2 months during the summer of 2018. During my time here, I developed a mobile gaming application called- [Meri Dukaan](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.prathamubs.meridukan&hl=en_IN&gl=US) to help teach basic concepts of banking and finance to the underprivileged kids residing in rural parts of India. The application was launched pan-India in collaboration with Pratham, an NGO, in March 2019. Since then, to date, the application is being used by 65,000+ active users across India.

_Application Developer Intern_ (June 2017) <br/>
This was a month long summer internship during which I was tasked with work of revamping the application's UI to make it more responsive and aesthetically modern. For this, I used Java and XML in the Android Studio IDE. I also desgined the application's UI in a way such that it is consistent with "three-click" rule to further enhance the user eperience.
