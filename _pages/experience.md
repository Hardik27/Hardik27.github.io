- **UBS, Mumbai** <br/>
_Software Engineer Intern_ (June 2018 - July 2018) <br/>
I interned at UBS for a period of 2 months during the summer of 2018. During my time here, I developed a mobile gaming application called- [Meri Dukaan](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.prathamubs.meridukan&hl=en_IN&gl=US) to help teach basic concepts of banking and finance to the underprivileged kids residing in rural parts of India. The application was launched pan-India in collaboration with Pratham, an NGO, in March 2019. Since then, to date, the application is being used by 65,000+ active users across India.


- **OTB Innovtech LLP** <br/>
_Application Developer Intern_ (June 2017) <br/>
This was a month long summer internship during which I was tasked with work of revamping the application's UI to make it more responsive and aesthetically modern. For this, I used Java and XML in the Android Studio IDE. I also desgined the application's UI in a way such that it is consistent with "three-click" rule to further enhance the user eperience.
