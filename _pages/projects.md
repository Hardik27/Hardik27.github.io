**Hindi to English: Transformer-Based Neural Machine Translation** <br/>
_Feb 2020- Sep 2020_ <br/>
The project aims at translating texts from Hindi to English by training the Transformer model. For this, we first cleaned the IIT Bombay CLIFT English-Hindi parallel corpus and then applied word level and sub-word level tokenization for the vocabulary creation. We implemented back-translation to augment the training data by ~3.5 million parallel records. The Transformer model along with sub-word level tokenization and back-translation led us to achieve state-of-the-art BLEU score on Hindi to English translation task. <br/>

**Topic Modeling on Research Articles** <br/>
_Aug 2020_ <br/>
Developed a multi-class classifier that takes 'Title' and 'Abstract' as the input and predicts the category to which it belongs it. Pre-processed the data to remove noise characters and then implemented stemming and lemmatization. Trained and compared the results of BERT, RoBerta, OVR Logistic Regression, Binary Relevance models. Achieved a mircro F1 score of 0.837 on the test data of ~9,000 records. <br/>
