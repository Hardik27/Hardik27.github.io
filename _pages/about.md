Hi, I am Hardik Ruparel, and I am from San Jose, CA. I recently graduated from the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/) with a Masters degree in Computer Science and I am currently working as a Software Engineer at Nutanix. I have completed my undergraduate studies in Information Technology from [Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI)](http://vjti.ac.in/), Mumbai in 2019. Post this I joined [UBS](https://www.ubs.com/in/en.html) and worked there as a software engineer.

My interests in Computer Science lies particularly in domains such as Software Development and Distributed Systems and I aspire to continue diving deeper into these domains. Following this interest, I have successfully completed my internship at Nutanix where I got the opportunity to work on projects in the field of distributed systems. Furthermore, at UBS I was responsible for developing back-end batch-jobs using Java and PL/SQL to calculate various Risk calculations. I have also accomplished the cloud migration of multiple back-end jobs and datasets to help enable the execution of these jobs on the cloud. 

Apart from academics and work, I enjoy playing sports. Sports instantly help me calm down and gather myself. Soccer has been one of my favorites. Along with soccer, I also relish cycling, playing cricket and table tennis.
